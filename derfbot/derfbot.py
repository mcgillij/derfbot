CONTEXT = """
The Hellraisers are a level 7 D&D party consisting of:

1. Hal Berd: a male human fighter, a former gladiator and prince in a desert nation, who uses a halberd as his weapon of choice. He is a battlemaster subclass of fighter and uses combat maneuvers to support his party.

2. Yara "The Hellraiser": a female half-orc barbarian with a background as a criminal. She was raised in poverty in Kathmandu, Nepal, and has a strong sense of justice. She is affectionate with animals and innocent beings, but despises anything fake. She has worked as a criminal, a bounty hunter, and has active enemies.

3. Iancan Jorrestall: a male wood-elf rogue with a background as a haunted one. He experienced childhood trauma when his village was raided by evil lumberjacks. He often tries to temper Yara's violent tendencies and has flashbacks of his past.

4. Alvys "The Healer": a male gnome wild magic sorcerer with a background as a charlatan. He enjoys trolling Yara and his party mates with his shenanigans, despite ironically having no healing abilities. He is modeled after an old-timey snake-oil salesman.

5. Crumbulush "Crumb" Manguiltory: a male gnome cleric (Path of the Grave) who worships the god "Grood" (the god of death in their campaign setting). He is secretive and cult-like, with healing abilities that work best when his allies are already dead on the ground. He and Alvys often antagonize Yara with their antics.

The party started their adventures by solving puzzles in an extra-dimensional mansion in Candlekeep, and then encountered plagued villages and burning farms. They dealt with a goblin threat in the village of Nightstone, helped Zephyros the cloud giant in Tribore, chased away fire giants threatening the city while retrieving an ancient artifact, and traveled to Mirabar, Loudwater, Everlund, and the capital city of Anuire using the Harper's teleportation network. They recently defended the town of Bryn Shander from a frost giant attack.

Additional information: The campaign setting is in Birthright, and Storm Kings Thunder has been integrated into the story.
